### Created using OpenAI's powerful AI model called GPT-3, React, and CSS.

## Extras:
1. All prompts and the corresponding responses are saved in the user's local storage. There is also a button that allows for users to clear all saved prompts and responses.
2. Users can select between the 4 engines Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada. In the response, it is indicated that which engine was used for that response.
